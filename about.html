        <h1>About me</h1>

        <hr>
        <p>
          At age 14, I embarked on a journey that took me to every continent as I sought to learn all the skills I would need to keep my vow. 
          I studied criminology, forensics, and criminal psychology, and learned from manhunters and martial artists, mastering every fighting style. 
          In time, I forged myself into a living weapon to wage war on crime and injustice. On my return to Gotham, I stalked street thugs as a plainclothes vigilante. Beaten by the very people I intended to protect, I barely survived my first night out. As I sat bleeding in my study at Wayne Manor I knew that I had to first strike fear in the hearts of my foes... 
          Just then, a bat crashed through the study window, giving my the inspiration I needed.
